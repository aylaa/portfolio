                    <p><strong>Course:</strong> AP CSA (AP Computer Science A)</p>
                    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> February 11-April 11, 2019</p>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> design and develop an Android application that solved an issue</p>
                    <p><strong>Type of project:</strong> partner</p>
                    <p>As Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming platforms grow in popularity, encouraging “binge-watching” with an overwhelming selection of media, it can be 
                           difficult to know which shows would best suit the interests of an individual. What 2 Watch was developed to combat this issue by providing a simple
                           user interface that would filter through a <a href="#">list</a> of movies and TV shows from IMDB based on the genres that the user selects, and then displays the 
                           resulting list with selections that match these preferences. During this project, I took a leadership role in developing the app in Android Studio. 
                           I learned developing skills including usage of Fragments, ArrayListAdapters, Enums, and more. Over halfway through the project, my partner and I presented a 
                           <a href="#">status report</a> of What 2 Watch, where we received positive and constructive feedback and gauged a better understanding of our next steps
                           in making our app more functional. At the end of the project, we presented our functional app via <a href="#">gallery walk</a>. The source code for the application 
                           is available on <a href="#">GitHub</a>.</p>

                    website whose proceeds from the website would go toward slave liberation organizations, such as <a href="https://www.freetheslaves.net/">Free the Slaves</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.notforsalecampaign.org/">Not for Sale</a>, and <a href="https://www.ijm.org/">International Justice Mission</a> in efforts to end

                    project, I designed and coded most of the front-end. (If the deadline was extended, I would work on backend as well, but time constraints did not allow
                    this part to be actualized.) My role also extended into <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vyPjieOZALIAZsEIXLbO8hFOivohkhuQc0jFCw48I8c/edit?usp=sharing">

                    <p>Our team created a solar-hydrogen vehicle that could travel one meter using four different energy configurations: 1 solar cell, 1 hydrogen cell, 
                    2 hydrogen cells, or 2 solar cells. Using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JFcg1FzFN4Z6ugxkeM5CzB_pVhNAoD8DKrtY6KdwOMk/edit">these</a> 
                    instructions and guidelines and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pAjefLqdpDhk3XMDlGC07OIC0o_VNXjx17rumKZi_JY/edit">this</a> rubric, we
                    concluded that the more efficient form of energy was using 2 solar cells. As team leader, I supervised and contributed to the building process and 
                    kept the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19kDWx5yMx6lgoH27BB5t6f3gelOTr_O-KqUtyTnYcYs/edit?usp=sharing">project report</a> updated,

                    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> April 2017 - June 2017</p>

                    accessible by just a press of a button. My team and I developed a modification to the Amazon Dash button where the user could pre-arrange an emergency phone call
                    message or text to send whenever the button was pressed. This way, if one ever found themselves in a situation in which they did not feel safe and needed a discreet
                    way to send for help, they had a way to do so. I developed an Android app where the user could input a message that would send when the button was pressed using
                    UDP packets. Another role of mine was the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_NgFoNlKd8JxjrSYmFFHxFqB0G7I58tSjSmRW77w6xI/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a>

                    <p><strong>Course:</strong> CSE (Computer Science/Software Engineering)</p>
                    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> March 13, 2017 - March 24, 2017</p>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> alter and manipulate images for a "client"</p>
                    <p><strong>Type of project:</strong> pair programming</p>
                    <p>In this project, my partner and I developed different images using a theme of avocados to advertise for a hypothetical avocado company. Out of 
                    several different options, we chose to create images for <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XwZqoQvu-Nd-JV3M7MQDvUL973pXtq1kEbkEzipUmgY/edit?usp=sharing">a
                    product (Client #3)</a> following this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B5P8CQRJM79p2EqbIRK8hhj6PGRBpvhr4tyJbpl8xX0/edit?usp=sharing">rubric</a>.
                    The biggest problem we encountered in this project was making the images alterations to a whole directory of images rather than one. To work around 
                    this, we used our resources and collaborated with other programmers, which ultimately led to the success of the project. From this project, I learned
                    to collaborate and cooperate with others more efficiently, more proficiently being able to use Python, and document progress/plan a project better.
