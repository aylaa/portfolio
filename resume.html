            <h3>A bit of my high school experience.</h3>
            
            <p>As part of the Engineering Academy at Dublin High School (DEDA), I have had the privilege to attend multiple field trips regarding different fields of
            engineering for exposure to different types of engineering. So far, I have been to SAP, where I met individuals working in the software development and 
            business side of a business-to-business technology company. A speaker from the head of the HR department explained to us the importance of seeking out leadership
            opportunities and making the most of our time in high school in terms of getting ahead in our careers, and I was able to understand what to expect in a software
            development office setting, likely similar to the environment I would be working at in the future. A field I had never looked too much into was aerospace, so
            to expand my interests and knowledge, I recently attended a field trip to a local hangar, where I learned about the different factors affecting speed, direction,
            agility, and gasoline consumption of a jet. While I do not envision myself entering the field in the future, it was memorable and eye-opening as to how far flight
            had developed and where technology in this field was headed.
            <br>
            <br>
            Last year, in my introductory computer science and programming class in the Engineering Academy, a few employees from Workday gave a presentation on what the 
            company does and more importantly how to get involved in the field. While not many of the workers from the field knew they wanted to work with computers from 
            the beginning, they had still landed managerial and development roles where they were quickly advancing in their field. Another inspiring aspect of these 
            employees was that they were all female; too often, guest speakers from the computer science field tend to be male.
            <br>
            <br>
            This year, Maynard Holliday, an older and very seasoned mechanical engineer, visited as a guest speaker. While this again was not my field of choice specifically,
            it was very inspiring to see how much an engineer can accomplish during their time working. Hired by Barack Obama during his presidency, working on the Chernobyl
            nuclear plant after its accident, and studying at Carnegie Mellon and Stanford University, his clear expertise and success motivated me to keep moving forward
            in what I want to do so I can be even more successful.</p>
