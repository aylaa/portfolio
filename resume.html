            <h3>A bit of my high school experience.</h3>
            
            <p>As part of the Engineering Academy at Dublin High School (DEDA), I have had the privilege to attend multiple field trips 
                regarding different fields of engineering for exposure to different types of engineering. So far, I have been to SAP, 
                where I met individuals working in the software development and business side of a business-to-business technology 
                company. A speaker from the head of the HR department explained to us the importance of seeking out leadership 
                opportunities and making the most of our time in high school in terms of getting ahead in our careers, and I was able to 
                understand what to expect in a software development office setting, likely similar to the environment I would be working 
                at in the future. A field I had never looked too much into was aerospace, so to expand my interests and knowledge, I 
                recently attended a field trip to a local hangar, where I learned about the different factors affecting speed, direction, 
                agility, and gasoline consumption of a jet. While I do not envision myself entering the field in the future, it was 
                memorable and eye-opening as to how far flight had developed and where technology in this field was headed.
                <br>
                <br>
                In my freshman year, in my introductory computer science and programming class in the Engineering Academy, a few employees
                from Workday gave a presentation on what the company does and more importantly how to get involved in the field. While not
                many of the workers from the field knew they wanted to work with computers from the beginning, they had still landed 
                managerial and development roles where they were quickly advancing in their field. Another inspiring aspect of these 
                employees was that they were all female; too often, guest speakers from the computer science field tend to be male.
                <br>
                <br>
                Last year, Maynard Holliday, an older and very seasoned mechanical engineer, visited as a guest speaker. While this again 
                was not my field of choice specifically, it was very inspiring to see how much an engineer can accomplish during their 
                time working. Hired by Barack Obama during his presidency, working on the Chernobyl nuclear plant after its accident, 
                and studying at Carnegie Mellon and Stanford University, his clear expertise and success motivated me to keep moving 
                forward in what I want to do so I can be even more successful.
                <br>
                <br>
                This past year, I participated in the DEDAâ€™s mentorship program where I was partnered with an industry professional who 
                was involved in the same career as I was interested in. My mentor was Sree Vakil, founder of a currently bootstrapped 
                company called Encliqued that is involved in software development. From her, I sharpened valuable corporate and life 
                skills including interviews, personal finance, and networking.
