            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Ayla Teittinen. I'm a junior at Dublin High School in the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy interested in pursuing a career in mobile app development. <br/><br/> I grew up with a very traditionally feminine childhood in which society
            taught me that science and math was for boys. For awhile, I believed it. Even though math and science were always more appealing to me and were my stronger suits, I confined to the path society told me to follow; that is, until my dad, a Google
            software engineer, convinced me to take a computer science class in seventh grade. <br/><br/> My first computer science class was quite mediocre: approximately five girls, including myself, in a class of thirty students. The class centered
            around a little language called Ch, a language derived from C that is very beginner-friendly and is essentially not used anywhere else. While it might not have been a very useful language to learn, it taught me the principles and basics of
            how computer programming worked, and to my surprise, taught me that I could actually be good at it. I consistently completed the assignments before the rest of my peers, even those who had already been introduced to coding before me, including
            the my male peers. My friends in the class constantly asked me to help them on their own projects, and I was able to do so. The boost in confidence I was given helped me realize that software was what I wanted to do with my life. <br/><br/>
            As a high school student living in the Silicon Valley, I am always reminded at how lucky I am to have access to a variety of opportunities aiding me in my path to becoming a successful software developer; of course, it is up to me to take
            advantage of these presented opportunities. Currently, I am involved in Dublin Engineering and Design Academy, where I take engineering courses that help me learn essential skills of the field I choose; GetSet, a program that encourages girls
            to enter careers in STEM; and Computer Science Association, a club in which I am a board member of and help other students at Dublin High School learn the basics of computer science as well. <br/><br/> In the future, I plan on attending
            a university to earn my Master's degree in Computer Science and my MBA, preferably at Stanford University (the distant dream) or UC Berkeley. I cannot wait to pursue my passion in the Silicon Valley and see where it takes me.</p>
