            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Ayla Teittinen. I’m a junior at Dublin High School in the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy interested 
		    in pursuing a career in mobile app development.
		    <br><br>
		    I grew up with a very traditionally feminine childhood in which society taught me that computers and engineering 
		    were for boys. For awhile, I believed it. Even though math and science were always more appealing to me and were
		    my stronger suits, I confined to the path society told me to follow; that is, until my dad, a Google software 
		    engineer, convinced me to take a computer science class in seventh grade.
		    <br><br>
		    My first computer science class was quite mediocre: approximately five girls, including myself, in a class of 
		    thirty students. The class centered around a little language called Ch, a language derived from C that is very 
		    beginner-friendly and is not widely used. While it might not have been a very useful language to learn, it taught
		    me the principles and basics of how computer programming worked, and to my surprise, taught me that I could 
		    actually be <em>good</em> at it. I consistently completed the assignments before the rest of my peers, even those
		    who had already been introduced to coding before me, including the my male peers. My friends in the class constantly
		    asked me to help them on their own projects, and I was able to do so. The boost in confidence I was given helped me
		    realize that software was what I wanted to pursue.
		    <br><br>
		    As a high school student living in the Bay Area, I am constantly reminded of how lucky I am to have access to a 
		    variety of opportunities aiding me in my path to becoming a successful software developer; of course, it is up to 
		    me to take advantage of these presented opportunities. Currently, I am involved in Dublin Engineering and Design 
		    Academy, where I take engineering courses that help me learn essential skills of the field I choose as well as 
		    provide me with amazing networking and mentorship opportunities with industry professionals; GetSet, a program that 
		    encourages girls to enter careers in STEM; and Qwerty Hacks, a hackathon that I am planning and leading as Head of 
		    Finance with some of my peers. Outside of engineering, I also serve as treasurer for my school’s chapter of Future 
		    Business Leaders of America (FBLA) where I help my chapter’s members compete in a variety of business- and tech-
		    related tests on top of my other treasurer responsibilities. I am also the social media manager for Dublin Youth 
		    Mayor’s Council, a prominent community service organization in my city that I am an active member of.
		    <br><br>
		    In the future, I plan on attending a university to earn my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Business
		    Administration, preferably at UCLA, and then continue into graduate school in either field (at which I hope to earn
		    at Stanford University). I cannot wait to pursue my passion in the Silicon Valley and see where it takes me.</p>
